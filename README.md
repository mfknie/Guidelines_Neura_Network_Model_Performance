# Guidelines_Neura_Network_Model_Performance
## Abstract
In the past few years, neural networks have gained in popularity due to the emergence of large size databases and the development of computational power of contemporary machines, through the use of GPUs in particular.  Neural networks are mathematical structures typically used to solve supervised or semi-supervised problems. The task performance of a neural network in model accuracy as well as in operation speed is strongly linked to its structure and parameter values of the optimization algorithm during its training.  This workshop will cover the fundamental guidelines that assist in understanding and optimizing network accuracy performance.
