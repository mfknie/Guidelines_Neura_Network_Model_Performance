# Guidelines_Neura_Network_Model_Performance
## Abstract
In the past few years, neural networks have gained in popularity due to the emergence of large size databases and the development of computational power of contemporary machines, through the use of GPUs in particular.  Neural networks are mathematical structures typically used to solve supervised or semi-supervised problems. The task performance of a neural network in model accuracy as well as in operation speed is strongly linked to its structure and parameter values of the optimization algorithm during its training.  This workshop will cover the fundamental guidelines that assist in understanding and optimizing network accuracy performance.

## Objectives:
1. During the workshop participants will be able to:
2. Understand model accuracy performance
3. Check for overfitting
4. Data dearth dealing
5. Hyperparameter tuning
6. Algorithm ensemble

## Level: 
Intermediate

## Duration: 
2 hours

## Prerequisites: 
All participants are expected to bring a laptop with a Mac, Linux, or Windows operating system that they have administrative privileges on. This workshop assumes participants possess prior programming experience, particularly in Python and Jupyter Notebook. An RCC account is not required
